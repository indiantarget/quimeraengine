Go to <wxWidgets installation folder>/build/msw

Building wxWidgets for Visual Studio 2010 (use Visual Studio's command prompt):
nmake -f makefile.vc BUILD=<Debug/Release> MONOLITHIC=0 SHARED=0 UNICODE=1

Building wxWidgets for GCC (Mingw32, which has to be accessible for the command prompt, this means, the folder where mingw32-make.exe file resides has to be added to the environment variable called PATH):
mingw32-make -f makefile.gcc BUILD=<Debug/Release> MONOLITHIC=0 SHARED=0 UNICODE=1

Building wxWidgets for GCC:
make -f makefile.gcc BUILD=<Debug/Release> MONOLITHIC=0 SHARED=0 UNICODE=1

Create a folder called wxWidgets.
Then, create another folder inside, called include. 
Copy original folders "include" and "lib" from wxWidgets library's installation folder.
If compiling using CodeBlocks on Windows (Mingw32), then it's necessary to link to Windows libraries, provided with CodeBlocks IDE:
 -Create a folder called windows_lib inside /3rdparty/wxWidgets/include/lib/.
 -Go to CodeBlocks installation folder.
 -Copy all the files (not folders) from the "/MinGW/lib" folder to the just created folder.
